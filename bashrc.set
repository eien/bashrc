## This is the .bashrc.set file, part of the BASHRC project
## at http://bashrc.sourceforge.net

## Has two sections, GENERAL and SYSTEM SPECIFIC

## GENERAL

## Version of this package
set bashrc_version=0.0.1

# When you press "Ctrl-D", should you exit the shell?
# If you are used to exit the shell with "Ctrl-D", disable this.
#set ignoreeof

# Define new prompt.
# Basic prompt.      (do a 'man bash' to get more about the flags)
# This shows the current path in inverse color and that is nice.
# It is important to know all the time in what directory you are.
#   explanation: %B begin bold, %b end bold, %S begin inverse, %s end inverse
#   explanation: %m short system name, %/ full directory name, %# is # or %
#   explanation: depending if you are root or non-root.

# New prompt, please try it out. Took me 3 days to get used to it fully.
# It's better in some respects than the previous one.
#   - more space to type command.
#   - shows username@currenthost currentdirectory
#   - can double-click with mouse to select so latter can paste somewhere
# Source: "UNIX Power Tools" from O'Reilly, note from Tim Cera (timcera@sourceforge.net).

# If set, minor errors in the spelling of a directory component in a cd command will be corrected.  The errors checked for are trans‚Äê
